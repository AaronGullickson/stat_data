The ANES data come from the 2016 ANES data, specifically `anes_timeseries_2016.dta` which is saved as a Stata .dta dataset. That dataset is not provided with this repository but can be [easily downloaded](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2016-time-series-study/) by registered ANES users.

Place that file in this directory to run `organize_data_politics.R`.
